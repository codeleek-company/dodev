# Contribute

If you are a developer and you want to contribute, you can develop with us trough adding new feature
or fixing a issue. To get started, clone the project, then make a new branch. Finally, when your code is done, make a pull
request to merge your new code

### How does the project work

- The project is very simple. It works with vite build and normal react comoponents

If you are contributing in the UI, focus on `src/pages` especially `src/pages/(statics) & src/pages/(user)` and `src/components` folders...

> The routing is handled by react-router-dom :)

And thanks
